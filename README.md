# Dragging-text-Tkinter
Just a small project where you can drag text onto a picture. Originally I wanted to make this because I was making tickets and I wanted to somehow make 230 tickets at once with a name of a person and their seat number. But at the end I was just playing around with tkinter and how it works.
